<td> [FoxBoard](http://www.acmesystems.it/?id=FOXG20) is a small but powerful Linux embedded system, sporting a Debian operative system and a rich set of solderless peripherals, known as the [Daisy modules](http://www.acmesystems.it/?id=index_daisy).</td>

[NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is a server-side Javascript development framework designed for very high concurrency, with extremely low overhead and blazingly fast response times. Its most invaluable library is Socket.IO, a fast communication library that implements web sockets (and much more) and enables true bidirectional real-time communication between the web server and its clients.

With NodeJS and its rich set of libraries, transforming your tiny FoxBoard into a full-fledged web-deployment platform is a breeze, and you will be amazed at the performance you can squeeze out of it.

FoxNode aim is to simplify usage of the FoxBoard and its related add-ons under the NodeJS framework, in order to fully leverage both the embedded hardware capabilities of the board and the productiveness and confort of a state-of-art web development platform.
