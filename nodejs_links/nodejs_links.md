### Links to further documentation ###

This library does not pretend to show each and every capability of the FoxBoard itself, nor to exhibit what can be accomplished with NodeJS: quite on the contrary, it just scratches the surface of what is possible. If you want to know more, we encourage you to dig into the copious documentation available online. 

To get you on track, here is a list of the most relevant starting points:

* [FoxBoard developer docs](http://www.acmesystems.it/?id=index_foxg20)
* [NodeJS official site](http://nodejs.org)
* [npm](http://npmjs.org/), the Node Package Manager, and the thousands of registered [modules](http://search.npmjs.org/)
* [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/), realtime communication for the browser
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/), higher level web-development framework
